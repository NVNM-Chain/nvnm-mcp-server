# Pre-Red-Team Security Assessment: NVNM Chain MCP Server

**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Last reviewed:** 2026-05-14 (Phase 8.12 OWASP Top 10 self-audit; see the "Update log" at the end)
**Scope:** Full repository defensive security review
**Status:** Assessment complete; remediation complete (see Phase 4)

> **Reading order.** This document is a point-in-time snapshot from 2026-04-01. Material covered by the snapshot (tool surface, dependency list, sha256-at-rest claim) has changed since. The authoritative current state lives in the "Update log" sections at the bottom (newest entries last) -- read those first if you want the as-of-today picture. Specifically:
>
> - Tool count: 16 -> **21** after Phase 8.8 (5 onboarding tools added).
> - EVM client: `go-ethereum` v1.17.2 -> **`defiweb/go-eth`** (MIT-licensed, vendored). The GPL-3.0 exposure that drove the swap is closed.
> - API keys: raw-at-rest -> **versioned-hash-at-rest** (v0 = plain SHA-256, v1 = HMAC-SHA256 under `KEY_HMAC_PEPPER`) with one-shot `.pre-migration` backup (Phase 8.6) + constant-time validation (Phase 8.7) + opt-in HMAC pepper (Phase 2).
> - Auth middleware chain: gained `originGuard` outermost (Phase 8.5) and IP-failure rate limiter (Phase 8.x).

## Phase 1: Repository-Grounded System Model

### 1. System Name and Business Purpose

**NVNM Chain MCP Server** (MCP server name: `nvnm-chain`, renamed from `inveniam-evm` in Phase 8.9) -- a Model Context Protocol server that exposes curated, typed tools for interacting with the NVNM Chain, Inveniam's L2 on MANTRA (Chain ID 787111). It translates MCP tool calls into EVM JSON-RPC and anchor precompile interactions, normalizes responses, and implements a prepare-sign-submit pattern for write operations where the server never holds private keys.

**Evidence:** [docs/DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) section 1; [README.md](../README.md) opening sections.

### 2. Architecture Summary

```
MCP Client / LLM Agent
        |
        | stdio or HTTP
        v
  Inveniam MCP Server
   /        |        \
  v         v         v
EVM L2   Anchor     OTLP Collector
(JSON-RPC) Precompile  (gRPC insecure)
           0x...0A00
                        Health/Metrics
                        :9090
```

Layered Go packages: `cmd/` -> `config`, `logging`, `telemetry`, `evm`, `anchor`, `mcp`. EVM layer is independent of anchor; anchor is independent of MCP; MCP orchestrates both.

### 3. Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go 1.26.2 (`CGO_ENABLED=0`)
- **MCP SDK:** `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` v1.4.1
- **EVM:** `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum` v1.17.2
- **Resilience:** `cenkalti/backoff/v5`, `sony/gobreaker/v2`, `golang.org/x/time/rate`
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry 1.42.0, Prometheus client 1.23.2
- **Runtime image:** `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12`
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (Kustomize + Helm), HPA

### 4. Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | From | To | Transport |
|---|---|---|---|
| TB1 | MCP Client/Agent | MCP Server | stdio (local) or HTTP (network) |
| TB2 | MCP Server | NVNM Chain RPC | HTTPS JSON-RPC |
| TB3 | MCP Server | OTLP Collector | gRPC (insecure) |
| TB4 | External scraper | Health/Metrics server | HTTP :9090 |
| TB5 | Operator/CI | Container image | Docker build + K8s deploy |

**Evidence:** `internal/mcp/server.go` lines 67-106; `internal/telemetry/telemetry.go` lines 139-141, 185-187; `deploy/k8s/deployment.yaml`.

### 5. Authentication and Authorization Model

**OBSERVED: No authentication or authorization exists at any layer.**

- MCP HTTP transport: no API keys, bearer tokens, mTLS, or auth middleware. The `http.Request` is ignored in the handler factory (`internal/mcp/server.go` line 79).
- Health/metrics endpoints: no authentication (`internal/telemetry/health.go` lines 58-63).
- Per-tool access control: none. All registered tools are available to any connected client.
- Write tools are gated only by a startup flag `ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS` -- not per-request authorization.

### 6. Sensitive Data Handled

| Data | Sensitivity | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| RPC URL (may contain API keys in query/userinfo) | High | `SafeURL` redacts at startup log; raw URL used in `ethclient.DialContext` and error messages |
| Blockchain addresses, tx hashes, balances | Low-Medium | Exposed in tool results by design |
| Unsigned transactions (calldata, gas, nonce) | Medium | Returned to MCP clients for signing |
| Signed raw transactions | High | Received via `evm_send_raw_transaction`, decoded and broadcast |
| ABI file | Low | Read from filesystem at startup |
| Private keys | Critical | **Never on server** (design invariant); present only in test/seed utilities |
| `.chain_credentials.txt` | Critical | Used by integration tests and seed CLI only; git-ignored |

### 7. Deployment Model

- **Local dev:** stdio transport, direct invocation
- **Production:** Docker (`distroless/static-debian12`), Kubernetes (Kustomize or Helm), behind reverse proxy (documented but not enforced)
- **Ports:** 8080 (MCP HTTP), 9090 (health/metrics)
- **No Ingress, NetworkPolicy, or ServiceAccount manifests in repo**

**Evidence:** `Dockerfile`; `deploy/k8s/`; `deploy/helm/`.

### 8. External Interfaces

| Interface | Direction | Protocol | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCP tools (16 total) | Inbound | stdio or HTTP | None |
| `/healthz`, `/readyz` | Inbound | HTTP | None |
| `/metrics` | Inbound | HTTP | None |
| EVM JSON-RPC | Outbound | HTTPS | URL-based only |
| OTLP telemetry | Outbound | gRPC | None (insecure) |

### 9. Known Security Controls Found in Repo

| Control | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Input validation (addresses, hashes, hex) | **Observed** | `parseAddress`, `parseHash`, `parseHexData` in `internal/mcp/tools_evm.go` lines 337-363 |
| Write tools off by default | **Observed** | `internal/config/config.go` line 90 |

| No retry on `SendRawTransaction` | **Observed** | `internal/evm/resilient.go` line 255 |
| `ReadHeaderTimeout` on HTTP server | **Observed** | `internal/mcp/server.go` line 86 |

### 10. Assumptions, Constraints, and Unknowns

**Assumptions:**

- MCP HTTP transport is behind a reverse proxy providing TLS termination and access control (documented in DESIGN.md but not enforced)
- Operator controls environment variable injection securely (K8s Secrets, cloud secret stores)
- RPC URL does not contain credentials in userinfo (not validated)

**Unknowns:**

- Whether a reverse proxy/API gateway is actually deployed in front of MCP HTTP
- Whether NetworkPolicies exist at the cluster level (none in repo)
- Whether OTLP collector enforces authentication
- How container images are scanned before deployment
- Whether `ghcr.io` image push is gated by branch protection or OIDC

### Secrets Flow Summary

```
Operator --[env var injection]--> NVNM_EVM_RPC_URL
                                     |
                      +--------------+--------------+

.chain_credentials.txt --[test/seed only]--> seed-test-data CLI
```

### Sensitive Data Flow Summary

- **Inbound signed transactions** arrive via `evm_send_raw_transaction` tool -> decoded in `SendRawTransaction` -> broadcast to chain
- **Unsigned transactions** prepared server-side (nonce, gas, calldata) -> returned to MCP client as structured JSON
- **RPC responses** (blocks, txs, balances, logs) normalized -> returned to MCP client
- **Tool call metadata** (method, tool name, duration, status) -> slog Info + OTel spans
- **Tool arguments and return values** explicitly NOT logged or traced

### AI/Agent-Specific Analysis

This is an **MCP tool server** consumed by AI agents/LLMs:

| Aspect | Status |
|---|---|
| Model providers | None (server is a tool provider, not a model consumer) |
| Retrieval components | None |
| Tools/function calls | 16 MCP tools (12 read, 4 write when enabled) |
| Memory/state | Stateless; MCP session managed by SDK |
| Approval paths | **None** -- no human-in-the-loop for tool execution |
| Provenance/audit | Operational logging only; no append-only audit |
| Sandboxing | Tools execute in-process; no sandbox |
| Prompt injection surface | Tool inputs parsed as structured JSON, not freeform text |

## Phase 2: Security Assessment

### Executive Summary

The NVNM Chain MCP Server has a solid defensive foundation: no server-side key material, distroless container, K8s security contexts, input validation on blockchain types, and the `gosec` linter. However, it has **zero authentication or authorization** on its HTTP interface, relying entirely on an undocumented reverse proxy assumption. This is the dominant risk. Secondary concerns include unbounded input sizes enabling denial of service, information leakage through error propagation and telemetry, inconsistent security hardening between K8s and Helm manifests, and absence of dependency vulnerability scanning in CI. For a system exposing blockchain write capabilities to AI agents, the lack of per-operation approval, audit logging, and rate limiting at the MCP layer represents a meaningful gap.

### Top 10 Most Plausible Attack Paths (Ranked)

**1. Unauthenticated MCP HTTP Access Leading to Blockchain Writes**

- **Evidence:** `internal/mcp/server.go` line 79 ignores `*http.Request`; no auth middleware; write tools registered at startup based on env flag
- **Label:** Observed
- **Why it matters:** Any network-reachable client can call `evm_send_raw_transaction` to broadcast pre-signed transactions, or use `anchor_prepare_*` tools to construct valid unsigned transactions for any address. Combined with a compromised signer, this enables unauthorized on-chain actions.
- **Attacker preconditions:** Network access to port 8080
- **Attack value:** High -- direct blockchain interaction
- **Blast radius:** All on-chain assets accessible to the anchor precompile
- **Defender-visible indicators:** `mcp.server.tool.calls` metric, structured logs with tool name
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Safe validation:** Attempt to call `tools/list` and `tools/call` from an unauthorized host; verify it succeeds
- **Mitigations:** Add authentication middleware (API key, mTLS, or OAuth2); enforce reverse proxy with auth; add per-tool authorization
- **Framework:** OWASP ASVS 4.1, STRIDE: Spoofing/Elevation, OWASP Top 10: A01 Broken Access Control

**2. Denial of Service via Unbounded Input to `parseHexData` / `SendRawTransaction`**

- **Evidence:** `internal/mcp/tools_evm.go` `parseHexData` (lines 360-362) performs `hex.DecodeString` with no max length; `internal/evm/client.go` `SendRawTransaction` (lines 224-236) decodes arbitrarily large hex
- **Label:** Observed
- **Why it matters:** A client can send multi-GB hex strings causing memory exhaustion and OOM kill
- **Attacker preconditions:** Network access to MCP HTTP
- **Attack value:** Medium -- service disruption
- **Blast radius:** Pod crash, all concurrent requests fail
- **Defender-visible indicators:** Memory spike in container metrics, OOMKilled events
- **Severity:** High
- **Safe validation:** Send a 100MB hex string to `evm_call_contract`; observe memory behavior
- **Mitigations:** Add max input length validation (e.g., 1MB) on hex data fields; set `http.Server.MaxHeaderBytes` and request body limits
- **Framework:** OWASP Top 10: A06 Vulnerable Components (DoS), STRIDE: DoS

**3. Information Leakage via Error Propagation to MCP Clients**

- **Evidence:** Tool handlers wrap and return upstream RPC errors to callers (e.g., `internal/mcp/tools_evm.go` lines 127, 222-223, 328-329); `internal/evm/client.go` line 56 includes full RPC URL in error string; OTel spans record full errors (`internal/telemetry/middleware.go` line 71)
- **Label:** Observed
- **Why it matters:** RPC URL with embedded API keys or internal hostnames can leak to untrusted MCP clients; error details reveal internal architecture
- **Attacker preconditions:** Ability to trigger errors (invalid inputs, network issues)
- **Attack value:** Medium -- credential/topology disclosure
- **Blast radius:** RPC API key compromise, internal network mapping
- **Defender-visible indicators:** None (errors returned normally)
- **Severity:** High
- **Safe validation:** Send invalid block number to `evm_get_block`; inspect returned error text for internal details
- **Mitigations:** Sanitize errors at the MCP handler boundary; return generic messages to clients; log details server-side only
- **Framework:** OWASP Top 10: A04 Insecure Design, CWE-209

**4. OTLP Telemetry Interception (Insecure gRPC)**

- **Evidence:** `internal/telemetry/telemetry.go` lines 139-141 `WithInsecure()` for traces; lines 185-187 `WithInsecure()` for metrics
- **Label:** Observed
- **Why it matters:** Telemetry data (including error text, request IDs, tool call patterns) transmitted in plaintext; can be intercepted or spoofed
- **Attacker preconditions:** Network position between server and OTLP collector
- **Attack value:** Medium -- metadata exfiltration, usage pattern analysis
- **Blast radius:** All telemetry data
- **Defender-visible indicators:** None (passive interception)
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Safe validation:** Capture traffic between server and OTLP endpoint; verify plaintext
- **Mitigations:** Use TLS for OTLP gRPC; use mTLS if collector supports it
- **Framework:** STRIDE: Information Disclosure, MITRE ATT&CK: T1040 Network Sniffing

**5. MCP HTTP Server Missing TLS, CORS, Request Body Limits**

- **Evidence:** `internal/mcp/server.go` lines 83-87: `http.Server` with only `ReadHeaderTimeout`; no `TLSConfig`, no CORS middleware, no `MaxBytesReader`
- **Label:** Observed
- **Why it matters:** Without TLS, MCP traffic (including signed transactions) is plaintext; without CORS, browser-based clients could make cross-origin requests; without body limits, large payloads can exhaust memory
- **Attacker preconditions:** Network access (TLS); browser-based attack (CORS)
- **Attack value:** Medium-High
- **Blast radius:** All MCP communications
- **Defender-visible indicators:** None for passive sniffing
- **Severity:** High (cumulative)
- **Safe validation:** Connect to `:8080` with HTTP (not HTTPS); send cross-origin request from browser
- **Mitigations:** TLS termination at reverse proxy (document and enforce); add CORS middleware; add `http.MaxBytesReader`
- **Framework:** OWASP Top 10: A02 Cryptographic Failures, A05 Security Misconfiguration

**6. Helm Chart Security Context Gaps vs Raw K8s Manifests**

- **Evidence:** `deploy/k8s/deployment.yaml` has full hardening (lines 22-65: `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `capabilities.drop: ALL`); `deploy/helm/.../deployment.yaml` lines 25-53 lacks `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation`, `capabilities.drop`
- **Label:** Observed
- **Why it matters:** Helm-deployed instances run with weaker security posture; container escape or privilege escalation easier
- **Attacker preconditions:** Container compromise
- **Attack value:** Medium -- privilege escalation
- **Blast radius:** Pod, potentially node
- **Defender-visible indicators:** `kubectl get pod -o jsonpath='{.spec.securityContext}'`
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Safe validation:** Deploy via Helm; inspect effective security context
- **Mitigations:** Align Helm template security context with raw K8s manifest
- **Framework:** CIS Kubernetes Benchmark, STRIDE: Elevation of Privilege

**7. No Dependency Vulnerability Scanning in CI**

- **Evidence:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` has no `govulncheck`, Snyk, Trivy, or SBOM step; 17 direct deps with `go-ethereum` v1.17.2 pulling extensive transitive tree (257 lines in `go.sum`); no Dependabot config
- **Label:** Observed
- **Why it matters:** Known CVEs in dependencies (especially `go-ethereum`, `gorilla/websocket` v1.4.2 transitive) would not be detected
- **Attacker preconditions:** Published CVE in dependency
- **Attack value:** Varies (up to Critical for RCE in geth)
- **Blast radius:** Full server compromise
- **Defender-visible indicators:** None without scanning
- **Severity:** Medium-High
- **Safe validation:** Run `govulncheck ./...` locally
- **Mitigations:** Add `govulncheck` to CI; enable Dependabot; pin Docker base images by digest
- **Framework:** OWASP Top 10: A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components, MITRE ATT&CK: T1195 Supply Chain

**8. No Audit Trail for Tool Invocations and Transaction Broadcasts**

- **Evidence:** `internal/telemetry/middleware.go` lines 33-34 explicitly state tool arguments and return values are not logged; `evm_send_raw_transaction` does not log tx hash; no append-only audit log
- **Label:** Observed
- **Why it matters:** Cannot forensically reconstruct what operations were performed, by whom (no auth = no identity), or what transactions were broadcast
- **Attacker preconditions:** Any access
- **Attack value:** N/A (detection gap)
- **Blast radius:** All post-incident investigation capability
- **Defender-visible indicators:** None (that is the problem)
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Safe validation:** Broadcast a transaction; attempt to find it in logs
- **Mitigations:** Add audit logging for write operations (at minimum: tool name, from address, tx hash, timestamp); separate audit log stream
- **Framework:** OWASP ASVS 7.1, MITRE ATT&CK: T1562 Impair Defenses

**9. No MCP-Level Rate Limiting (Agent Abuse)**

- **Evidence:** No rate limiter on HTTP or MCP layer; upstream RPC rate limiter only protects the EVM node, not the MCP server itself
- **Label:** Observed
- **Why it matters:** A rogue or compromised AI agent can flood the server with tool calls, exhausting resources or generating excessive RPC costs
- **Attacker preconditions:** MCP client access
- **Attack value:** Medium -- resource exhaustion, cost amplification
- **Blast radius:** Server availability, upstream RPC billing
- **Defender-visible indicators:** `mcp.server.tool.calls` counter spike
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Safe validation:** Send 1000 concurrent `evm_get_chain_id` calls; measure resource impact
- **Mitigations:** Add per-client rate limiting middleware; implement connection limits
- **Framework:** OWASP Top 10: A04 Insecure Design

**10. Docker Base Image Not Pinned by Digest**

- **Evidence:** Prior to remediation, `Dockerfile` used tag-based base images rather than digest-pinned references.
- **Label:** Observed
- **Why it matters:** Tag-based references are mutable; a supply chain attack on the base image registry would silently affect builds
- **Attacker preconditions:** Compromise of Docker Hub or GCR image tags
- **Attack value:** High -- code execution in build or runtime
- **Blast radius:** All deployed instances
- **Defender-visible indicators:** Image hash mismatch (if tracked)
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Safe validation:** Compare `docker inspect` digests across builds
- **Mitigations:** Pin base images by `@sha256:...` digest; use Cosign/Sigstore verification
- **Framework:** SLSA Level 2+, MITRE ATT&CK: T1195.002

### Abuse and Misuse Cases

1. **Rogue AI Agent Flooding Writes:** An LLM agent in a loop calls `anchor_prepare_add_registry` thousands of times, generating valid unsigned transactions that could be signed and broadcast, creating spam on-chain.
2. **Reconnaissance via Error Probing:** Attacker sends malformed inputs to each tool, collecting error messages that reveal internal hostnames, RPC endpoints, ABI structure, and software versions.
3. **Transaction Front-Running via OTLP Interception:** Attacker intercepts plaintext telemetry to observe transaction patterns and timing, enabling front-running strategies.
4. **Resource Exhaustion via Large Hex Payloads:** Attacker sends multi-GB hex data to `evm_call_contract` or `evm_send_raw_transaction`, causing OOM and crashing the pod.
5. **Metrics Scraping for Intelligence:** Unauthenticated `/metrics` endpoint reveals tool call patterns, error rates, RPC latency, and circuit breaker state -- useful for timing attacks or identifying degraded states.

### AI/Agent-Specific Findings

**A1. No Human Approval for Write Operations**

- **Attack objective:** AI agent autonomously constructs and signs transactions without human oversight
- **Entry vector:** Agent has MCP client access + signing capability
- **Violated trust assumption:** Prepare-sign-submit assumes signing is a deliberate human action; an autonomous agent bypasses this
- **Safe simulation:** Configure an agent with signing key access; observe whether it self-approves writes
- **Mitigation:** Implement approval workflow (confirmation tool, rate limits on prepare operations, signing requires human confirmation)

**A2. Tool Description Injection (Indirect Prompt Injection)**

- **Attack objective:** Manipulate agent behavior through crafted tool response data
- **Entry vector:** Malicious on-chain data (registry names, record metadata) returned in tool responses that influence agent reasoning
- **Violated trust assumption:** Tool responses are treated as trusted data by consuming agents
- **Safe simulation:** Seed a registry with a name containing instruction-like text; observe agent behavior
- **Mitigation:** Document that MCP tool outputs contain untrusted on-chain data; consuming agents should treat responses as untrusted

**A3. No Provenance or Audit Trail for Agent-Initiated Actions**

- **Attack objective:** Deny accountability for agent-initiated blockchain operations
- **Entry vector:** Any agent with MCP access
- **Violated trust assumption:** Operations can be attributed and investigated
- **Safe simulation:** Have multiple agents use the server; attempt to attribute specific operations
- **Mitigation:** Add request identity (API key / client cert) and audit logging with caller identity, tool arguments for write operations, and transaction hashes

---

## Phase 3: Pre-Red-Team Readiness Plan

### Top Priorities to Fix Now (Immediate)

1. **Add authentication to MCP HTTP transport** -- API key header check at minimum; mTLS for production. This is the single highest-impact fix.
2. **Add request body size limits** -- `http.MaxBytesReader` wrapper and max hex input length validation in `parseHexData` and `SendRawTransaction`.
3. **Sanitize errors at the MCP boundary** -- Return generic error categories to clients; log full details server-side only. Specifically fix the RPC URL leak in `internal/evm/client.go` line 56.
4. **Add audit logging for write operations** -- Log tool name, `from` address, prepared tx hash, and broadcast tx hash for write tools.

### Controls to Verify Immediately

1. Confirm a reverse proxy with TLS and auth is deployed in front of `:8080` in production (or document that it is not)
2. Confirm NetworkPolicies exist at the cluster level restricting ingress to `:8080` and `:9090`
3. Confirm OTLP collector is not network-exposed and uses TLS
4. Run `govulncheck ./...` against current codebase
5. Verify `.chain_credentials.txt` is not present in any deployed image or artifact

### Detections to Enable Before Testing

1. Alert on `mcp.server.tool.calls` counter spike (>100/min for write tools)
2. Alert on container OOMKilled events
3. Alert on MCP HTTP connections from unexpected source IPs (if network logging exists)
4. Alert on `evm.rpc.errors` counter spike (may indicate probing)
5. Monitor `evm.rpc.rate_limited` counter

### Assumptions the Red Team Is Likely to Challenge

1. "A reverse proxy provides auth" -- they will try direct access to `:8080`
2. "No private keys on the server" -- they will look for credential files, env leaks, error messages containing secrets
3. "Write tools are off by default" -- they will check if the env var can be influenced
4. "Distroless = no shell = limited post-exploit" -- they will check for any writable paths, `/tmp` mount
5. "Rate limiting on RPC protects the server" -- they will DoS the MCP layer directly

### Tabletop "Assume Breach" Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Compromised MCP Client**

A rogue agent gains MCP access. It enumerates all tools, probes error messages for internal details, floods prepare operations, and if signing capability is available, broadcasts unauthorized transactions. No audit trail exists. Detection relies entirely on metrics counter anomalies.

**Scenario 2: RPC URL Credential Leak**

The RPC URL contains an API key in the query string. A client triggers a connection error (e.g., by causing a timeout). The error propagates through the tool response containing the full URL. The attacker now has direct RPC access, bypassing the MCP server entirely.

**Scenario 3: Container Escape via Dependency Vulnerability**

An unpatched CVE in a `go-ethereum` transitive dependency allows code execution. The attacker finds `/tmp` is writable (Helm deployment) but the root filesystem is read-only. They attempt to exfiltrate environment variables (including RPC URL) via the insecure OTLP channel.

### Executive Talking Points on Residual Risk

1. **Authentication is the critical gap.** The server currently trusts any network-reachable client. This is acceptable for local stdio use but unacceptable for HTTP deployment.
2. **The "no keys on server" design is sound.** The prepare-sign-submit pattern is the right architecture. The risk shifts to agent autonomy if signing is automated.
3. **Observability is good but not forensic.** Tool call patterns are metered, but the explicit decision to not log arguments means write operations cannot be forensically reconstructed.
4. **Supply chain posture needs hardening.** No vulnerability scanning, no image signing, no SBOM. This is common for early-stage projects but needs addressing before production.
5. **The Helm chart is weaker than the raw K8s manifests.** Anyone deploying via Helm gets a less secure configuration.

### Pre-Red-Team Test Plan

| # | Test Objective | Component | Hypothesis | Safe Validation | Access Level | Expected Evidence | Pass/Fail Criteria | Owner | Remediation If Failed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Verify MCP HTTP requires auth | MCP Server `:8080` | No auth exists | `curl -X POST http://<host>:8080/ -d '...'` | Network | HTTP 200 with session ID | **Fail** if 200 without credentials | Platform | Add auth middleware |
| 2 | Verify health endpoints require auth | Health `:9090` | No auth exists | `curl http://<host>:9090/healthz` | Network | HTTP 200 with status JSON | **Fail** if 200 from untrusted source | Platform | Add auth or restrict to cluster-internal |
| 3 | Test input size limits | `evm_call_contract` | No limit exists | Send 10MB hex `data` parameter | MCP client | OOM or slow response | **Fail** if server accepts without limit | Dev | Add `MaxBytesReader` + input length check |
| 4 | Test error information leakage | `evm_get_block` | Errors contain internal details | Send invalid block ref, inspect error | MCP client | Error text with hostnames/URLs | **Fail** if internal details visible | Dev | Sanitize at handler boundary |
| 5 | Verify OTLP encryption | Telemetry gRPC | Plaintext | Packet capture between server and collector | Network | Plaintext protobuf | **Fail** if unencrypted in production | Infra | Enable TLS on OTLP |
| 6 | Verify Helm security parity | Helm deployment | Missing hardening | `kubectl get pod -o yaml`, compare security contexts | Cluster admin | Missing fields | **Fail** if differs from raw K8s | Dev | Align Helm template |
| 7 | Dependency vulnerability scan | `go.mod` | Unknown CVEs | Run `govulncheck ./...` | Dev | Vulnerability list | **Fail** if high/critical CVEs | Dev | Patch or mitigate |
| 8 | Verify no credential artifacts in image | Docker image | Clean image | Inspect Docker layers | Dev | No credential files | **Fail** if credentials found | Dev | Update `.dockerignore` |
| 9 | Test write tool gating | MCP Server | `ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS=false` blocks writes | Call `anchor_prepare_add_registry` with writes disabled | MCP client | Tool not found error | **Pass** if tool unavailable | Dev | N/A |
| 10 | Verify no audit gap for writes | `evm_send_raw_transaction` | No tx hash logged | Broadcast tx, search all logs | MCP client + log access | Missing tx hash in logs | **Fail** if tx hash not logged | Dev | Add audit logging |

### Hardening Priority Tiers

**Immediate Fixes (Before Red Team):**

- Authentication middleware on MCP HTTP
- Request body size limits
- Error sanitization at MCP boundary
- Audit logging for write operations
- Run `govulncheck`

**Before Red Team (Within 1 Week):**

- Align Helm security context with raw K8s
- TLS for OTLP gRPC (or document collector is localhost-only)
- Add `govulncheck` + Dependabot to CI
- Add NetworkPolicy to K8s manifests
- Pin Docker base images by digest

**Longer-Term Hardening:**

- Per-tool authorization (RBAC)
- MCP-level rate limiting per client
- Image signing with Cosign/Sigstore
- SBOM generation in CI
- Structured audit log with client identity
- Human-in-the-loop approval for write operations when consumed by autonomous agents
- Document and enforce reverse proxy requirements
- Consider `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, `IdleTimeout` on HTTP server
- License scanning for dependency compliance

## Phase 4: Remediation Results

**Remediation date:** 2026-04-01

All "Immediate Fixes" and "Before Red Team" items have been implemented. Each finding below references the original attack path number.

### Immediate Fixes -- Completed

#### Finding 1: Unauthenticated MCP HTTP Access -- REMEDIATED

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Fix | Multi-key Bearer token authentication middleware |
| Files | `internal/mcp/auth.go` (new), `internal/mcp/keys.go` (new), `internal/auth/context.go` (new), `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/mcp/server.go`, `cmd/nvnm-mcp-server/main.go` |
| Config | `MCP_API_KEYS_FILE` (path to JSON key store, preferred) or `MCP_API_KEY` (single key fallback) |
| Behavior | When configured, all HTTP requests must include `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Each key maps to a client ID that flows through to audit logs and OTel spans. Server warns at startup if HTTP transport runs with no keys configured. |
| Key management | `cmd/key-mgmt/` CLI tool; Makefile targets `key-create`, `key-disable`, `key-enable`, `key-list` |
| Verification | `go test ./internal/mcp/...` passes; manual end-to-end test of key create/disable/list confirmed working |
| Residual risk | No per-tool authorization (RBAC) yet; health/metrics endpoints (`:9090`) remain unauthenticated |

#### Finding 2: Denial of Service via Unbounded Input -- REMEDIATED

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Fix | Request body size limits + hex input length caps |
| Files | `internal/mcp/server.go`, `internal/mcp/tools_evm.go`, `internal/evm/client.go` |
| Changes | `http.MaxBytesReader` wrapper caps request bodies at 10 MB. `MaxHeaderBytes` set to 1 MB. `parseHexData` rejects hex strings > 2 MB (1 MB decoded). `SendRawTransaction` rejects signed tx hex > 2 MB. `ReadTimeout` (60s), `WriteTimeout` (120s), `IdleTimeout` (120s) added to HTTP server. |
| Verification | `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` pass |

#### Finding 3: Information Leakage via Error Propagation -- REMEDIATED

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Fix | Error sanitization at MCP boundary + RPC URL leak removed |
| Files | `internal/evm/client.go`, `internal/errors/errors.go`, `internal/anchor/revert.go`, `internal/telemetry/middleware.go` |
| Changes | `NewClient` error no longer includes the raw RPC URL. New `SafeForClient()` function in `internal/errors/` classifies errors: input/not-found errors pass through unchanged; upstream and internal errors are replaced with generic messages. Applied in the telemetry middleware so OTel spans still get the full error for internal debugging, but the MCP response to the client is sanitized. **Precompile revert reasons** (from gas estimation) are classified at the anchor boundary (`internal/anchor/revert.go`) against a fixed allowlist: a recognized caller-input rejection (e.g. an oversized checksum) is surfaced as `ErrPrecompileValidation` carrying a **canonical, hard-coded reason** — never the raw revert string — so actionable input errors reach the caller while internal type paths (e.g. Cosmos proto paths) still collapse to the generic message. |
| Verification | `go test ./...` passes |

#### Finding 8: No Audit Trail for Write Operations -- REMEDIATED

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Fix | Audit logging with client identity for all write tool handlers |
| Files | `internal/mcp/tools_evm_write.go`, `internal/mcp/tools_anchor_write.go`, `internal/telemetry/middleware.go` |
| Changes | `evm_send_raw_transaction` logs `client_id`, `tx_hash` on success; `client_id`, `signed_tx_len`, `error` on failure. `anchor_prepare_add_registry` logs `client_id`, `from` (redacted), `registry_name`. `anchor_prepare_add_record` logs `client_id`, `from` (redacted), `registry`, `uri`. `anchor_prepare_grant_role` logs `client_id`, `from` (redacted), `registry_id`, `account` (redacted), `role`. Telemetry middleware logs `client_id` on every tool call and adds it as an OTel span attribute. |
| Verification | `go test ./...` passes |

#### Finding 5 (partial) / govulncheck: Dependency Vulnerability -- REMEDIATED

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Fix | Upgraded `google.golang.org/grpc` v1.79.2 -> v1.79.3 |
| Finding | `govulncheck` identified GO-2026-4762 (authorization bypass via missing leading slash in `:path`) in the transitive `grpc` dependency. Our code did not call the vulnerable symbols, but the package was exposed. |
| Verification | `govulncheck ./...` now reports zero vulnerabilities |

### Before Red Team -- Completed

#### Finding 6: Helm Chart Security Context Gaps -- REMEDIATED

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Fix | Aligned Helm chart with raw K8s deployment manifest |
| Files | `deploy/helm/nvnm-mcp-server/values.yaml`, `deploy/helm/nvnm-mcp-server/templates/deployment.yaml` |
| Changes | Pod security context now includes `runAsUser: 65532`, `runAsGroup: 65532`, `runAsNonRoot: true`. Container security context now includes `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, `capabilities.drop: [ALL]`. Values split into `podSecurityContext` and `containerSecurityContext` for clarity. |
| Verification | Template renders correctly with new values structure |

#### Finding 4: OTLP Telemetry Insecure gRPC -- REMEDIATED

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Fix | Made OTLP insecure mode configurable |
| Files | `internal/telemetry/telemetry.go`, `internal/config/config.go`, `cmd/nvnm-mcp-server/main.go` |
| Changes | New `OTLP_INSECURE` env var (default `true` for backward compatibility). When set to `false`, OTLP gRPC trace and metric exporters connect with TLS instead of `WithInsecure()`. Insecure mode is logged at startup for visibility. |
| Residual risk | Default remains insecure; operator must explicitly opt in to TLS. Documented as an operational requirement. |

#### Finding 7: No Dependency Vulnerability Scanning in CI -- REMEDIATED

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Fix | Added `govulncheck` to CI pipeline + Dependabot configuration |
| Files | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/dependabot.yml` (new) |
| Changes | CI now runs `govulncheck ./...` before tests. Dependabot configured for `gomod`, `docker`, and `github-actions` ecosystems on a weekly schedule with up to 10 open PRs. |

#### Finding 7 (supplement): No NetworkPolicy -- REMEDIATED

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Fix | Added NetworkPolicy to K8s manifests |
| Files | `deploy/k8s/networkpolicy.yaml` (new), `deploy/k8s/kustomization.yaml` |
| Changes | Ingress restricted: port 8080 only from pods labeled `app.kubernetes.io/component: mcp-client`; port 9090 open for probes/metrics. Egress restricted to HTTPS (443), OTLP gRPC (4317), and DNS (53). Added to Kustomize resource list. |
| Residual risk | Ingress selectors are templates; operators must adjust `podSelector`/`namespaceSelector` for their cluster topology. |

#### Finding 10: Docker Base Images Not Pinned by Digest -- REMEDIATED

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Fix | Both Dockerfile base images pinned by `sha256` digest |
| Files | `Dockerfile` |
| Changes | `golang:1.26.2-alpine` pinned to `@sha256:f85330846cde1e57ca9ec309382da3b8e6ae3ab943d2739500e08c86393a21b1`. `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12` pinned to `@sha256:20bc6c0bc4d625a22a8fde3e55f6515709b32055ef8fb9cfbddaa06d1760f838`. Dependabot will flag when newer digests are available. |

### Longer-Term Items -- Triaged

The following items from the "Longer-Term Hardening" tier have been triaged with the following dispositions:

| Item | Disposition | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Human-in-the-loop approval for write ops | **No longer a server-side control** | Removed in the Option 0 stateless migration. The former MCP-elicitation approval (`internal/mcp/approval.go`) and its `WRITE_APPROVAL_DEFAULT` / per-key `write_approval` knobs no longer exist. Writes gate on RBAC role (`writer`/`admin`/`automation`) plus `ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS`; obtaining human confirmation before submitting a signed transaction is the client/agent's responsibility (stated in the server's `initialize` instructions). The caller-side signature remains the security boundary. |
| Reverse proxy requirements | **Done** | Operational guide with nginx example added to `docs/DESIGN.md` section 10. |
| SBOM generation in CI | **Completed (`c357898`)** | `anchore/sbom-action` emits CycloneDX JSON artifact on every push to `main`. |
| MCP-level rate limiting per client | **Completed (`568ae50`)** | Token-bucket per-client limiter via `MCP_RATE_LIMIT` (default 60 req/s) and `MCP_RATE_BURST` (default 10). Returns HTTP `429` when exceeded. Implementation in `internal/mcp/ratelimit.go`. |
| Image signing with Cosign/Sigstore | **Completed (`c357898`)** | Cosign keyless signing of compiled binary on `main` push via Sigstore OIDC. Image-digest signing requires registry decision (still pending; tracked in the project backlog). |
| License scanning for dependency compliance | **Completed (`c357898`)** | `go-licenses` check on every push/PR with explicit allowed-licenses list. |
| Per-tool authorization (RBAC) | **Completed (`568ae50`); default-deny hardened (branch `feat/rbac-default-deny`)** | Roles on API keys (`reader`, `writer`, `admin`, `automation`); FusionAuth maps via `roles` claim. All 21 tools gated; `ErrPermissionDenied` is client-safe. Authorization is default-deny: an authenticated key authorizes only the tools its assigned roles permit; a key with no roles authorizes nothing. `MCP_API_KEY_ROLES` is required when `MCP_API_KEY` is set — the server refuses to boot without it. |
| CORS middleware | **Backlog (Low)** | Low priority since auth is enforced; only relevant if browser-based MCP clients are used. |
| Self-serve key request workflow | **Backlog (Medium)** | Allow clients to request an API key via an endpoint; a human or agent reviews and approves. Builds on the admin key management API. |

### Summary (refreshed 2026-04-28)

| Tier | Total | Remediated | Documented Only | Backlog |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Immediate Fixes | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| Before Red Team | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| Longer-Term | 8 | 7 | 0 | 1 |
| **Total** | **18** | **17** | **0** | **1** |

All findings rated High or Critical have been remediated. Of the original 8 Longer-Term items, 7 have shipped (5 since the original assessment in commits `c357898` and `568ae50`); only **CORS middleware** remains in the backlog and is rated Low priority. Remaining open items are tracked in the project backlog.

## Update 2026-04-28: Longer-term backlog delivery

The original assessment marked 6 items as "Backlog" and 2 as "Done" in the Longer-Term tier. As of 2026-04-28, 5 of those 6 backlog items have been delivered:

| Item | Status as of 2026-04-01 | Status as of 2026-04-28 |
|---|---|---|
| SBOM generation in CI | Backlog (Medium) | **Completed** -- `c357898` |
| MCP-level rate limiting per client | Backlog (Medium) | **Completed** -- `568ae50` |
| Image signing with Cosign/Sigstore (binary) | Backlog (Medium) | **Completed** -- `c357898` |
| License scanning | Backlog (Low) | **Completed** -- `c357898` |
| Per-tool authorization (RBAC) | Backlog (Low) | **Completed** -- `568ae50` |
| CORS middleware | Backlog (Low) | Still backlog (Low) |

In addition, **FusionAuth OAuth/JWT authentication** was added in Phase 6 as a second auth provider alongside API keys, and **MetaMask wallet signing support** was added in Phase 7 with a `wallet_tx_request` payload returned from every `anchor_prepare_*` tool. Neither was scoped in the original audit but both materially improve the production security posture (centralized identity, browser-wallet UX without server-side keys).

---

## Update 2026-05-11: Phase 8 in progress

Phase 8 is layering additional security and onboarding controls on top of the Phase 5–7 baseline. As of 2026-05-11 the following Phase 8 items have shipped on `main`:

| Item | Phase 8 task | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tool annotations on every tool** (`ReadOnlyHint` / `DestructiveHint` / `OpenWorldHint` profiles) | 8.2 | `d0cc16f` | Lets MCP clients and connector-directory reviewers tell read-only from state-changing tools without relying on spec defaults. `evm_send_raw_transaction` is the only `DestructiveHint=true` tool; `anchor_info` is the one `OpenWorldHint=false` tool. |
| **`next_actions` envelope on every tool response** | 8.3 | `3b88f3b` | Static AST reachability test prevents stale tool-name references in hint strings. |
| **EIP-1559 (type-2) prepare-tools by default** | 8.4 | `2e9e751` | Backwards-compat: `gas_price` field dual-populated on type-2 responses; `prefer_legacy_tx` input parameter for opt-out. Verified end-to-end against testnet for both transaction types. |
| **Origin-header validation on HTTP transport** | 8.5 | `cc8ca80` | DNS-rebinding defense per the MCP spec. Outermost middleware so rejection short-circuits before auth or rate-limit work. Allowlist via `NVNM_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; localhost-only default. |

Phase 8 also tracks the following security items still pending:

| Item | Phase 8 task | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **API-key hashing at rest** with `.pre-migration` backup + atomic tmp-rename writes | 8.6 (IRREVERSIBLE) | Current `main` stores raw bearer tokens on disk in operator-managed key stores. Any earlier "stored hashed at rest" claim in this document is **not yet accurate** -- the migration in 8.6 will make it true. Until 8.6 ships, operators should treat the key store file as a high-sensitivity secret comparable to `.env`-style credentials. |
| Constant-time auth comparison on the hash bytes | 8.7 | Defense-in-depth alongside the hash-lookup path. |
| Server identity rename + `INVENIAM_*` → `NVNM_*` env-var hard cut with fail-loud guard | 8.9 (BREAKING) -- **SHIPPED 2026-05-13** | Eliminates the dual-prefix transient state. Strict policy: legacy var detected at startup fails loud even when the matching `NVNM_*` is also set. See `docs/RUNBOOK.md#env-var-migration`. |
| Binary + Docker artifact identity rename (`cmd/inveniam-mcp-server/` → `cmd/nvnm-mcp-server/`; ghcr image `inveniamcapital/inveniam-mcp-server` → `inveniamcapital/nvnm-mcp-server`; K8s `metadata.name` and `app.kubernetes.io/name` labels; Grafana dashboard `uid`) | 8.13 (BREAKING) -- **SHIPPED 2026-05-13** | Companion to 8.9. Atomic rename of the publishing surface so the project no longer carries the old identity outside the rc.1/rc.2 CHANGELOG history. Old ghcr image stays in place but receives no further updates. |
| OWASP Top-10 self-audit gate | 8.12 | Final close-out before Phase 8 marked COMPLETE. |

---

## Update 2026-05-12: Fresh pre-red-team review and remediation

A second pre-red-team assessment was conducted on 2026-05-12, grounded
in the post-Phase-8.5 codebase. It surfaced seven previously-unflagged
or partially-remediated issues plus several Go code-review findings.
The full assessment is preserved in conversation; the items below
record what was fixed in the codebase.

### Top-10 attack paths (2026-05-12 review)

| # | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Credential stuffing -- rate limiter was post-auth | **Remediated** -- new `IPFailRateLimiter` (pre-auth, per source IP) in `internal/mcp/failrate.go`; `AuthMiddleware` calls `Penalize` on every 401. |
| 2 | Unbounded growth of per-client rate-limiter map | **Remediated** -- `ClientRateLimiter` now bounded by `DefaultLimiterMaxClients` (10000) with LRU eviction and a TTL janitor; same pattern applied to `IPFailRateLimiter`. |
| 3 | HTTP transport failed open with no keys configured | **Remediated** -- `loadAPIKeys` now returns `config.ErrHTTPAuthRequired` when `Transport=="http"` and no validator can be constructed. Test asserts the fail-closed path. |
| 4 | API-key store written non-atomically | **Remediated** -- `SaveKeysFile` now writes to a sibling `.tmp-*` file (`0o600`, fsync'd) and renames over the target. Test asserts the previous file is preserved when the rename fails. |
| 5 | Admin REST `:8081` lacked defense-in-depth | **Remediated** -- default bind moved to `127.0.0.1:8081` (BREAKING for deploys that exposed it cluster-wide). Admin auth now compares SHA-256 hashes (fixed length) so `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`'s "fast on length mismatch" shortcut cannot probe the admin-key length. NetworkPolicy template includes an example for in-cluster admin access. |
| 6 | K8s `Deployment` pulled `:latest` | **Documented** -- `deployment.yaml` carries an explicit TODO + comment block describing how to substitute `@sha256:<digest>` once the release pipeline emits a digest-stable image; the existing Dockerfile already digest-pins both base images. (Real fix requires a release-pipeline change outside this commit set.) |
| 7 | CI license allowlist permitted GPL-3.0 / LGPL-3.0 | **Remediated** -- allowlist narrowed to MIT/Apache-2.0/BSD-2/BSD-3/ISC/MPL-2.0/Unlicense/CC0-1.0/0BSD/Zlib/EPL-2.0/CDDL-1.0. Matches the project's dependency-license policy. CI is the safety net; if a transitive GPL-3 dep exists today it will surface on the next run. |
| 8 | ConfigMap shape encouraged secret-in-ConfigMap | **Remediated** -- new `deploy/k8s/secret.yaml.example` documents the Secret pattern; `deployment.yaml` wires both `configMapRef` (non-sensitive) and `secretRef` (credentials), plus a volume mount for `MCP_API_KEYS_FILE` from a separate Secret. `configmap.yaml` cleaned of credential-shaped fields and `INVENIAM_EVM_RPC_URL` removed. `.gitignore` now excludes `deploy/k8s/secret.yaml`. |
| 9 | `OTLP_INSECURE` default was `true` | **Remediated** -- default flipped to `false` (BREAKING for sidecar/localhost-collector deploys that did not explicitly set the var). Comment on the new default explains the rationale and the opt-in path. |
| 10 | Approval prompt opaque on method + signer | **Remediated** -- `DecodeTxSummary` now extracts the first 4 bytes of calldata as a `method_selector` field, recovers the signer address from the signature, and threads the chain environment ("testnet"/"mainnet") through `NewServer` so the prompt renders chain ID with a human label. `formatApprovalMessage` shows `Signer (recovered)`, `Method selector`, and a `wei (≈ X ETH)` value formatted with thousand separators. |

### Go code review findings (2026-05-12)

| Finding | Status |
|---|---|
| ConstantTimeCompare on raw admin key length-leaked the key length | **Remediated** -- admin now hashes both sides with SHA-256 before constant-time compare; the apikey-validator placebo is left for Phase 8.7 as planned. |
| Telemetry middleware comment claimed errors were not recorded -- but `span.RecordError(err)` does record them | **Remediated** -- comment corrected to describe the actual privacy model (errors on span, sanitized to client). |
| `auth.go` returned 403 for invalid bearer (should be 401 per RFC 7235) | **Remediated** -- all bearer-failure paths now return 401 in both `AuthMiddleware` and `adminAuth`. Tests updated. |
| `OriginAllowlist.Resolved` used a hand-rolled insertion sort | **Remediated** -- replaced with `sort.Strings`. |
| `anchor_prepare_*` annotated `OpenWorldReadOnly` but required write role -- semantic mismatch flagged | **Re-examined and kept** -- annotation is correct per MCP spec (no environment modification). Tool description now explicitly documents the role requirement so connector-directory reviewers don't mis-read the annotation. |
| Audit log line message inconsistent across write tools (`audit: foo`, `audit: foo phase`) | **Remediated** -- all five write-handler audit lines now use `slog.Group("audit", ...)` with stable `tool`, `phase`, and `client_id` keys. |
| Chain-environment silent fallback to testnet when chain ID unrecognized | **Remediated** -- `Validate()` now refuses to start when no environment can be resolved; operators on private forks must set `NVNM_CHAIN_ENVIRONMENT` explicitly. |
| Dockerfile build image version vs `go.mod` toolchain drift | **Remediated** -- Dockerfile sets `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.3` in the build stage so reproducible builds do not depend on `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` downloading whatever point release happens to be current. |
| New tests | `failrate_test.go`, `keys_atomic_test.go`, `parsehex_fuzz_test.go`, `apikey_bench_test.go`, plus `cmd/nvnm-mcp-server/main_test.go` covering fail-closed HTTP startup. |

### AI/agent-specific (2026-05-12)

| Finding | Status |
|---|---|
| Indirect prompt injection via on-chain string fields | **Documented** -- `docs/SECURITY_CONSUMER_GUIDANCE.md` describes the threat, the server's stance ("we don't sanitize on-chain truth"), and the defenses consumers should apply. |
| Approval-substitution attack via signed-tx swap | **Mitigated** -- approval prompt now shows recovered signer + method selector so the user has the surface to spot a substituted transaction. |

### Breaking-config callouts (operators read this)

Three changes in this remediation set are intentionally breaking for
existing deployments:

1. **`ADMIN_API_ADDR` default is now `127.0.0.1:8081`.** Deploys that
   expected cluster-wide access on `:8081` must explicitly set
   `ADMIN_API_ADDR=:8081` AND restrict it via NetworkPolicy.
2. **`OTLP_INSECURE` default is now `false`.** Sidecar / localhost
   collector deploys that previously relied on the insecure default
   must set `OTLP_INSECURE=true` explicitly.
3. **`NVNM_CHAIN_ENVIRONMENT` is required when chain ID is not
   recognized.** Deploys against private forks or unfamiliar chain
   IDs must set this explicitly; the previous silent fallback to
   testnet is gone.

### Summary (refreshed 2026-05-12)

| Tier | Total | Remediated | Documented Only | Backlog |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-01 audit (re-audited) | 18 | 17 | 0 | 1 |
| 2026-05-12 audit (top-10) | 10 | 9 | 1 (image digest -- needs release pipeline) | 0 |
| 2026-05-12 Go code review | 9 | 9 | 0 | 0 |
| 2026-05-12 AI/agent | 2 | 1 doc + 1 mitigated | 0 | 0 |

Phase 8.6 (API-key hashing at rest) and Phase 8.7 (constant-time auth
on the hashed bytes) shipped together on 2026-05-13 -- see the entry
below. Phase 8.9 (env-var hard cut) and Phase 8.12 (OWASP self-audit
gate) remain on the Phase 8 roadmap as originally scoped.

## Update 2026-05-13: go-ethereum replaced by defiweb/go-eth

The license-allowlist tightening committed on 2026-05-12 (commit
`6580ddc`) failed CI because `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum` is
classified GPL-3.0 by go-licenses and the consumed library packages
ship under LGPL-3.0 (which the project's dependency-license policy
hard-refuses or case-by-cases). The temporary fix at
`c06da61` restored the allowlist; this entry records the permanent
remediation.

### What changed

`github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum` has been **removed from the
dependency tree entirely** and replaced with
`github.com/defiweb/go-eth v0.7.0` (MIT). Affected surfaces:

| Surface | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Common types | `common.Address`, `common.Hash`, `common.HexToAddress`, `common.IsHexAddress`, `common.BytesToHash`, `common.Bytes2Hex` | `defitypes.Address`, `defitypes.Hash`, `defitypes.AddressFromHex`, `defitypes.HashFromBytes` |
| Transaction model | `core/types.Transaction`, `LegacyTx`, `DynamicFeeTx`, `NewTx`, `SignTx`, `Sender`, `NewLondonSigner`, `LatestSignerForChainID`, `NewEIP155Signer` | `defitypes.Transaction` (fluent builder; single type with `SetType(LegacyTxType\|DynamicFeeTxType)`), `defiwallet.PrivateKey.SignTransaction`, `deficrypto.ECRecoverer.RecoverTransaction` |
| RPC client | `ethclient.Client`, `ethclient.DialContext` | `rpc.Client`, `transport.NewHTTP` |
| ABI codec | `accounts/abi.ABI`, `abi.Pack`, `abi.Unpack`, `abi.JSON` | `defiabi.Contract`, `Method.EncodeArgs`, `Method.DecodeValues`, `defiabi.ParseJSON` |
| Filter query | `ethereum.FilterQuery` | `defitypes.FilterLogsQuery` |
| Call message | `ethereum.CallMsg` | `defitypes.Call` |

### Verification gate

A build-tagged differential test (`internal/anchor/abi_diff_test.go`,
`//go:build verification`) was added that imported BOTH go-ethereum
and defiweb, loaded the same `abi/anchoring.json` into both libraries,
and asserted byte-for-byte equality of the ABI-encoded calldata for
every method shape the production server constructs: `addRegistry`,
`addRecord` (the highest-risk surface -- a single tuple struct with
10 fields including dynamic strings + uint64 + bool), and `grantRole`.
The test ran 13 cases (short/empty/unicode/long-string/JSON-meta
matrix per method) and passed all of them. Once the byte-equality
property was established, the differential test was deleted to allow
go-ethereum's complete removal from `go.mod`. Future encoder regressions
will surface via the existing integration tests against testnet.

### Vendoring

`vendor/` is now committed (≈32 MB). Build/test/CI use `-mod=vendor` so
a compromised upstream module cannot affect a build that succeeded
locally. To refresh: `go mod tidy && go mod vendor`. Vendoring is
warranted by supply-chain risk; the trade-off (repo size) is small
relative to the licensing exposure that vendoring closes off.

### CI / docs follow-up

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: license allowlist tightened back to the
  permissive-only set (no GPL-3.0, no LGPL-3.0); build/test now use
  `-mod=vendor`.
- `docs/LICENSE_EXCEPTIONS.md`: cleared of the temporary go-ethereum
  entry; no active exceptions.
- `docs/SECURITY_CONSUMER_GUIDANCE.md` and other docs that reference
  "go-ethereum-derived" details are unchanged; their content describes
  the on-chain ABI surface, not the Go library that encodes it.

### Operational risk callouts

1. **defiweb is a small-org dependency.** Bus factor is real. The
   vendored copy is the safety net; in the event of upstream
   abandonment, the vendored source is forkable in-place.
2. **defiweb's RPC client does not surface `Block.BaseFeePerGas` as a
   typed field.** EIP-1559 prepare-tools rely on `MaxPriorityFeePerGas`
   (eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas) and `GasPrice` (eth_gasPrice), neither of
   which depends on the BaseFee field. Read tools that returned
   BaseFee previously now return `nil` for that field. The README and
   tool descriptions advertised it as best-effort; no consumer is
   known to depend on it.
3. **Address output format changed**: defiweb's `Address.String()` is
   lowercase by default; go-ethereum's `.Hex()` was EIP-55 checksummed.
   To preserve API compatibility, all production address outputs go
   through `evm.AddressHex(...)` which calls `Address.Checksum(...)`
   to produce the EIP-55 form. Tests assert the EIP-55 output.

## Update 2026-05-13: Phase 8.6 and 8.7 (hashed-at-rest, constant-time auth)

API keys are now stored hashed at rest, indexed by hash in memory,
and compared by hash bytes under constant time. The earlier
"hashed at rest" claim in this document was inaccurate until this
commit -- it now reflects what `main` actually does.

### What changed

| Surface | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `KeyEntry` on disk | `{id, key (raw), enabled, ...}` | `{id, key_hash (sha256 hex), key_prefix (first 8 chars), enabled, ...}` -- `key` retained only as a load-only legacy field for one-shot migration. |
| `KeyEntry` in memory | raw `Key` field populated | `Key` field empty post-migration; never re-populated. |
| `KeyStore` index | `map[rawKey]*KeyEntry` | `map[keyHashHex]*KeyEntry`. `Lookup(rawKey)` hashes the input before probing. |
| `KeyResult` (auth-package interface) | included raw `Key` field | `Key` removed; `KeyHash` added. The validator never sees a raw key beyond the initial token argument. |
| `APIKeyValidator.Validate` | `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare(token, entry.Key)` (placebo since map lookup used the same raw bytes) | `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare(HashKey(token), entry.KeyHash)`. Both sides are fixed-length sha256 hex digests, so `ConstantTimeCompare`'s length-mismatch shortcut cannot leak. Miss path burns a placeholder compare to flatten hit/miss timing. |
| `SaveKeysFile` | atomic tmp+fsync+rename (from 2026-05-12 audit work) | unchanged, plus advisory `flock(LOCK_EX \| LOCK_NB)` while writing, so a key-mgmt CLI and a running server cannot race when both honor the lock. |
| `LoadKeysFile` | single-path read | on parse failure, falls back to `<path>.tmp` for recovery from an interrupted write (best-effort). |
| Migration trigger | n/a | `NewManagedKeyStore` detects pre-8.6 entries on first load; writes a one-shot `<path>.pre-migration` backup (never overwritten by subsequent migrations); rewrites the primary file in hashed form; logs INFO on success, WARN on save failure but continues startup. |
| `KeyEntry` constructor for new keys | direct struct literal with raw `Key` set | `NewKeyEntry(id, rawKey, writeApproval, roles)` -- hashes once, captures prefix, never retains raw key. Production callers (`main.go` single-key path, `Create`, `cmd/key-mgmt`) all routed through this constructor. Direct `KeyEntry{... Key: ...}` literals are confined to `internal/mcp/keys.go` (migration helper) and `internal/mcp/keys_migration_test.go` (migration regression tests). |
| `summarize` (admin REST `List`) | derived prefix from `e.Key` | reads `e.KeyPrefix` directly; raw-key fallback removed. |

### Migration behavior on first startup against a legacy file

1. `LoadKeysFile` returns entries with raw `Key` populated, no `KeyHash`.
2. `migrateLegacyEntries` walks the slice in place: for each entry
   with `Key != "" && KeyHash == ""`, compute hash + prefix, clear
   `Key`. Returns `(true, count)` so the caller can persist.
3. `NewManagedKeyStore` writes `<path>.pre-migration` as a verbatim
   copy of the original file. **One-shot**: if the backup already
   exists from a prior migration cycle, it is left untouched -- the
   first backup is the truest "what did we have before hashing ever
   ran" record.
4. `SaveKeysFile` rewrites the primary file in hashed form. On
   failure (read-only FS, permission, etc.), the in-memory state is
   still normalized so auth keeps working; next admin CRUD will
   re-persist. Server startup is not failed by a save error.
5. Subsequent restarts find `KeyHash` already populated; migration
   is a no-op and no backup is written.

### Migration regression test coverage (`internal/mcp/keys_migration_test.go`)

- `LegacyFileMigratedAndBackedUp` -- a pre-8.6 file is migrated; the
  one-shot backup contains the original bytes; the primary file
  contains no raw bearer tokens after the migration; Lookup works
  post-migration with the raw key as input.
- `ReloadIsNoop` -- a second `NewManagedKeyStore` on the same path
  does not overwrite the backup (a sentinel byte string written into
  the backup file survives) and does not rewrite the primary file.
- `AlreadyHashedFileUntouched` -- a file written via `NewKeyEntry`
  produces no backup on load.
- `InterruptedWriteRecoveredFromTmp` -- a malformed primary + a
  well-formed `.tmp` produces a recovered load.
- `LegacyEntryWithoutKeyOrHashSkipped` -- entries with neither raw
  Key nor KeyHash are preserved in memory (with no way to
  authenticate) so an operator notices rather than silently losing
  the entry.

### Constant-time defense detail

The previous `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare(token, entry.Key)` was a
placebo because the preceding map probe used the same raw bytes as
the comparison input -- if Lookup returned non-nil, `entry.Key`
equaled `token` by construction and the compare always returned 1.
The new path is meaningful: the map probe is by hash, and the
post-lookup compare is also by hash. Both arguments to
`ConstantTimeCompare` are fixed-length sha256 hex digests, so the
"length mismatch returns 0 immediately" shortcut cannot be used to
probe the digest.

Miss-path timing: the validator now invokes a placeholder constant-
time compare on the miss path so unknown-key and
known-key-with-wrong-digest paths spend roughly the same CPU,
defeating timing-based distinction by a remote attacker.

### Operational notes for operators upgrading

- **Back up `MCP_API_KEYS_FILE` before the first restart on the new
  binary.** The server writes a `.pre-migration` backup
  automatically, but an out-of-band copy is cheap insurance.
- The migration runs once on first restart. After that, the file is
  in the new hashed shape and the `.pre-migration` backup is left
  alone forever.
- If the server logs `legacy keys migrated in memory but failed to
  persist`, the in-memory state is correct but the disk file is
  still in the legacy shape. The next admin CRUD will re-persist;
  if no admin CRUD is expected, fix the underlying filesystem issue
  and restart the server.

## Update 2026-05-14: Phase 8.12 OWASP Top 10 self-audit

Phase 8.12 (the Phase 8 close-out gate) produced a categorized OWASP
Top 10:2021 coverage matrix for the current `main` posture. It lives
in its own document, [`docs/OWASP_AUDIT.md`](OWASP_AUDIT.md), rather
than as an entry here, because it has a different lifecycle: this
document is an append-only dated log, while the OWASP matrix is a
**living document** that Phase 9 and Phase 10 extend in place as new
surface lands.

The two are complementary and cross-referenced: this log records
*what changed and when*; the OWASP matrix records *how the current
posture maps to the framework*, and cites the relevant findings here
inline.

### Disposition summary (see `docs/OWASP_AUDIT.md` for the full matrix)

| # | Category | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| A01 | Broken Access Control | PARTIAL — `:9090` auth + conditional RBAC noted |
| A02 | Cryptographic Failures | PARTIAL — transport TLS is a reverse-proxy responsibility |
| A03 | Injection | COVERED |
| A04 | Insecure Design | COVERED |
| A05 | Security Misconfiguration | PARTIAL — K8s `:latest` pinning → Phase 10 |
| A06 | Vulnerable and Outdated Components | COVERED |
| A07 | Identification and Authentication Failures | COVERED |
| A08 | Software and Data Integrity Failures | PARTIAL — image-digest signing → Phase 10 |
| A09 | Security Logging and Monitoring Failures | PARTIAL — append-only audit stream → Phase 10 |
| A10 | Server-Side Request Forgery | COVERED |

No new Critical or High findings were surfaced by the self-audit. The
PARTIAL dispositions are all either documented operator-boundary
responsibilities or named deferrals to Phase 9 / Phase 10; none is a
silent gap. The green-target sweep run as part of the same close-out
(`make test`, integration suite against testnet, `govulncheck`,
`golangci-lint` full-tree covering `gosec` + `staticcheck`) passed.

## Update 2026-05-26: Phase 9.13 pre-flip secrets scrub audit

**Scope.** Pre-flip-to-public audit (sequencing step 13 of Phase 9 OSS
Readiness). Strategy fixed at design time as **rotate-if-found, do
not rewrite history** (decision D5). Three independent scanners run
against the working tree and full git history (135 commits at
`0926633` HEAD).

**Tools and invocations.**

```sh
detect-secrets scan --all-files                                 # codebase, fresh
gitleaks   detect --redact --no-git --source .                  # codebase second-opinion
gitleaks   detect --redact --source .                           # full git history
git secrets --register-aws && git secrets --scan-history        # AWS-pattern history pass
```

`git-secrets` was installed via Homebrew for this audit; previously
absent on the audit host. The AWS pattern set was registered because
`git secrets` ships with no built-in patterns.

**Findings — tracked surface (the part that matters for the public
flip).** Every finding falls into category (a) "test fixture /
known-fake" per the plan's classification grid. Zero findings in
category (b) "actual secret to rotate" and zero in category (c)
"false positive to baseline."

| File (tracked) | Tool that flagged | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `.secrets.baseline` (7 entries) | gitleaks history + detect-secrets | (a) — the file IS the secrets baseline. Each line is a hashed-secret entry by design; flagging it is scanner-meta, not a finding. |
| `internal/mcp/server_e2e_test.go` (4 hits at historical commit `5e91f82185`, lines 467/488/498/573) | gitleaks history | (a) — fake test fixtures: `"valid-key-123"`, `"strict-key-123"`. Names self-document their fixture role. The strings persist in history but never represented real credentials at any point. Current HEAD's e2e harness uses `NewKeyEntry(...)` constructors, but the historical struct-literal form persists in `git log` (which is exactly what the history scan exists to find). |
| `cmd/seed-test-data/main.go:49,55,61` | detect-secrets | (a) — fake SHA256-shape hex strings in `Checksum:` fields of testnet seed records. Pattern (`a1b2c3d4e5...`, `d4e5f6a7b8...`, `789abcde0...`) is obviously placeholder, not credential material. |
| `docs/TOOL_REFERENCE.md:978` | detect-secrets | (a) — `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855` is the SHA256 hash of the empty string (well-known constant, `echo -n '' \| sha256sum`). Used as the example checksum in tool documentation. Not a credential. |

**Findings — gitignored working-tree files (operator-local; not part
of the audit's repo-flip scope).** gitleaks `--no-git` walks the
filesystem and ignores `.gitignore`, so it flagged `.env` (FUSIONAUTH
ids, NVNM_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY), `.chain_credentials.txt`, and
`test_oauth.sh`. All three confirmed by `git log --all --` to have
**zero commits touching them** — never committed, never push-able.
These are operator-local development artifacts, not repo-history
exposure. detect-secrets additionally flagged ~40 entries under
`graphify-out/cache/ast/*.json` and `graphify-out/graph.json`; the
entire `graphify-out/` tree is gitignored (confirmed via
`git check-ignore`). Operator-local responsibility.

**`git secrets --scan-history` with AWS patterns: clean** (zero
findings, exit `0`).

**Disposition.**

- **Rotations performed:** none. No real credentials were ever
  committed.
- **Baseline updates:** none. The existing `.secrets.baseline`
  already covers the file's own hashed-entry self-flagging; the
  remaining findings are all known-fake fixtures or SHA256(empty),
  intentionally documented above rather than suppressed in the
  baseline so that *why* they're acceptable is recoverable by a
  future auditor without spelunking commit history. The "no
  drive-by baseline updates" stance matches the project's
  hand-curated-docs convention.
- **History rewrite:** **not performed** (per D5). No history blob
  contains material that warrants the irreversible cost and
  remote-rebase burden of a rewrite.
- **Tooling state:** `git-secrets` installed locally for the audit;
  the project's CI does not currently invoke it. `detect-secrets`
  remains the pre-commit hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml:29-32`,
  observed in Phase 1).

**Audit pass status: CLEAN.** Phase 9.13's exit criterion ("repo
history contains no rotatable real secret") is met. The repo is
secrets-clean for the Phase 9.15 public flip.

**Scope notes for future auditors.**

- Re-run this exact sequence before each subsequent public-affecting
  change (Phase 9.15 itself, any module-path rewrite that touches
  every file, any merge of a long-running fork).
- If `.secrets.baseline` is ever rotated to a different schema, the 7
  scanner-meta hits will move with it; that's expected.
- The historical `5e91f82185` server_e2e_test.go state is preserved
  as-is because rewriting history to swap `valid-key-123` for a
  different fake string would invalidate every downstream commit SHA
  for zero security gain — the string was never a real credential
  and the file no longer carries it at HEAD.

Audit run at `0926633`; tooling versions: `detect-secrets 1.5.0`,
`gitleaks` (Homebrew current), `git-secrets 1.3.0`.

## Update 2026-06-11: MCP authorization-spec compliance (WWW-Authenticate + well-known)

Discovered by dogfooding the server as an HTTP MCP client in Claude Code:
the client reported "Needs authentication" even with a valid static
`Authorization: Bearer` token, while raw `curl` with the same token
returned `200`. Root cause was a two-part MCP-authorization-spec gap in the
HTTP transport (not a credential or RBAC defect):

1. **No `WWW-Authenticate` challenge on 401s.** `AuthMiddleware`
   (`internal/mcp/auth.go`) wrote bare `401`s with no challenge header, so a
   spec-following client could not determine the scheme. **Remediated** — a
   new `writeUnauthorized` helper now sets `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` on all
   three 401 paths (missing header, wrong scheme, invalid credentials). The
   challenge is **plain Bearer with no `resource_metadata` parameter** by
   design: this server authenticates opaque API keys / FusionAuth JWTs
   supplied out-of-band, so it must signal "send a bearer token," not "begin
   an OAuth discovery flow."

2. **OAuth discovery well-known paths returned a gated 401.**
   `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and
   `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` fell through to `AuthMiddleware`
   and answered `401`, which a Claude-class client reads as "OAuth-protected
   resource I cannot reach." **Remediated** — a new `wellKnownGuard`
   (`internal/mcp/wellknown.go`), placed ahead of `AuthMiddleware` in the
   chain, answers `404` for exactly those two paths (signaling "no OAuth
   discovery; use configured credentials") and passes every other path
   through untouched, so `/.well-known/jwks.json` and any future well-known
   resource are unaffected.

**Scope and verification.** No change to credential validation, the
constant-time compare, RBAC, rate limiting, or CORS. Coverage added in
`internal/mcp/auth_test.go` (challenge header on every 401) and
`internal/mcp/wellknown_test.go` (404 for the two OAuth paths, pass-through
otherwise). Server-side behavior was reproduced and confirmed end-to-end
through the full middleware chain (`CORS → originGuard → IPFailRateLimiter →
limitRequestBody → wellKnownGuard → AuthMiddleware`) against a local binary:
well-known → `404`, no-auth → `401` + `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`, valid key →
`200`. The remaining client-side confirmation — that Claude Code itself flips
to "Connected" — is a black-box client behavior validated separately at
release, not assertable from the server code.

## Update 2026-06-17: Option 0 — server-side write approval removed

The "Human-in-the-loop approval for write ops — **Completed**" disposition in
the longer-term-hardening triage above is **superseded**. Server-side write
approval was removed in the Option 0 stateless multi-replica migration: the MCP
elicitation prompt before `evm_send_raw_transaction` (the only server→client
request), the per-client `write_approval` field, the global
`WRITE_APPROVAL_DEFAULT`, and the FusionAuth `automation → auto` mapping are all
gone, and `internal/mcp/approval.go` is deleted.

Write authorization now rests on two controls: RBAC role
(`writer`/`admin`/`automation`) and the `ENABLE_WRITE_TOOLS` flag. Obtaining
human confirmation before submitting a signed transaction is the client/agent's
responsibility (stated in the server's `initialize` instructions). The
caller-side signature remains the security boundary — the server was never the
write security boundary and holds no key material. The tradeoff (enforced →
advisory) was recorded as part of the Option 0 stateless migration.

Migration is fail-loud, consistent with the `INVENIAM_* → NVNM_*` hard cut:
startup aborts with `ErrLegacyWriteApproval` if `WRITE_APPROVAL_DEFAULT` is set,
or `ErrLegacyKeyWriteApproval` (naming the offending key IDs) if any key-store
entry still carries `write_approval`. Operator steps:
`docs/RUNBOOK.md#write-approval-removal`.

## Update 2026-06-23: Default-deny RBAC hardening (feat/rbac-default-deny)

The RBAC implementation completed in `568ae50` has been hardened to
default-deny:

- **Authorization is default-deny.** An authenticated key authorizes only the
  tools its assigned roles permit. A key with no roles authorizes nothing — the
  previous behavior (no-role key was unrestricted) is gone.
- **`MCP_API_KEY_ROLES` is now required** when `MCP_API_KEY` is set. The server
  refuses to boot without it (`ErrMissingAPIKeyRoles`). This closes the gap
  where a single-key dev deployment could accidentally run without any role
  assignment.
- **No-identity callers are not affected.** stdio transport and anonymous
  keyless reads gated by the upstream authentication allowlist are allowed by
  that allowlist, not by RBAC; they are unaffected by this change.

The "Per-tool authorization (RBAC)" row in the longer-term-hardening triage
above has been updated to reflect these changes.

## Update 2026-06-24: Phase 2 HMAC+pepper versioned key hashing

API-key hashing now supports a versioned scheme. The purpose: a server-held
pepper makes a database-only key-store dump non-reversible offline, providing
defense-in-depth against a leaked key-store file. Peppering is **opt-in** and
zero-config deployments are byte-for-byte unchanged.

### What changed

| Surface | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `HashKey` / `keyhash.go` | `sha256(rawKey)` → hex | `hash_version`-tagged digest: `v0` = plain SHA-256 (unchanged, default); `v1` = HMAC-SHA256 under `KEY_HMAC_PEPPER` when set. |
| `KeyEntry.KeyHash` on disk | plain SHA-256 hex | same field; value is a plain 64-char hex digest in both versions — the scheme is identified by the adjacent `hash_version` field (omitted/0 = v0, 1 = v1), not by a prefix inside the hash string. |
| `APIKeyValidator.Validate` | single candidate compare | versioned candidate lookup: computes v1 candidate when pepper active, v0 always; constant-time compare on the matching candidate. |
| Boot validation | n/a | `ErrPepperPreviousWithoutActive`: server refuses to start if `KEY_HMAC_PEPPER_PREVIOUS` is set without `KEY_HMAC_PEPPER`. |
| Boot logging | n/a | Logs `peppered: true` / `rotation_window: true` booleans at INFO on startup; never logs pepper material. |

### Scope

- **Opt-in.** `KEY_HMAC_PEPPER` unset → behavior is byte-for-byte v0. No
  action needed for existing deployments.
- **Legacy `v0` keys keep working.** On authentication, the validator tries
  both the v1 candidate (if pepper active) and the v0 candidate. Legacy keys
  continue to authenticate unchanged.
- **No persisted re-hashing in this phase.** Persisted migration of `v0` keys
  to `v1` on disk is deferred to the Postgres backend (Phase 3). Until then,
  `v0` keys stay `v0` on disk; they authenticate correctly but do not gain the
  pepper benefit until Phase 3 re-hashes them.
- **Rotation window.** `KEY_HMAC_PEPPER_PREVIOUS` (optional) allows
  validating keys hashed under the prior pepper while new keys are written
  under `KEY_HMAC_PEPPER`. Setting it without `KEY_HMAC_PEPPER` fails boot.

### Env-var reference

Canonical rows are in `.env.example` and `docs/RUNBOOK.md §Authentication`.
Short form: `KEY_HMAC_PEPPER` (optional, enables v1); `KEY_HMAC_PEPPER_PREVIOUS`
(optional, rotation window, requires `KEY_HMAC_PEPPER`).
